<h3 id="markdown">Introduction</h3>

<p>This project aims to visualise a certain dataset published by National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB) on either Crime, Suicides or Prison Statistics.
  I chose to work on a dataset about the Suicides in India by state and cause. I made a hypothesis to start of with and then I used the Tableau public tool to visualise the data and analyse it further to verify my hypothesis.</p>

<h3>About the Dataset</h3>

<p>The chosen dataset is obtained from Data World and it is called "Suicides in India". This was because of the inavailability to download from the NCRB website which is under maintenance. This provides data of suicides reported from 29 states, 7 UTs, ranging from 2001 - 2014 based on type, gender and age group of the concerned. I used the Tableau Public tool to clean the dataset and keep only the required data.</p>

<h3>HYPOTHESIS: Is there a relationship between suicides committed with respect to the person’s gender, geographical location and their respective socio-economic factors?</h2>

<h4 id = "one">Analysis #1: General visualisation of the whole dataset.<a href="#main_content_wrap"> UP</a></h4>

<p>Given the hypothesis we can use the visualisation provided to view the general varying trends in suicide number with respect to male and female. This was done to look into each cause by selecting them from the list on the right side, and trying to see any abnormalities in the data which could be used for further study.
  For example, if we click on "Family Problems" from the list we can see which states have higher number of suicides corresponding to it. We see that interestingly, the number of men in kerala committing suicide for this reason is much higher women in the same area. This is different from the other states and could be looked at deeper for some insights.
  This visualisation also gives us a bigger picture on the total number of suicides from each state. We can already see from these examples that there could be a relationship between gender and geographical location. </p>


<h4 id = "two">Analysis #2: Relationship between literacy rate, suicide rate and cause of suicide. <a href="#main_content_wrap">UP</a></h4>
<p>The literacy rates in India have seen a general upward trend from 2001 to 2011 according to the census. It has been reported that as of 2011, Kerala has the highest literacy rate at 93.91% and Tripura at 87.75% (Tripura is currently highest as of 2015). The interesting thing to note is that the decadal difference from 2001 for both is 3.05% and 14.56% respectively.
  In this view, I visualised the change in possbible causes for suicide that could be related to the change in literacy rate between 2001 and 2011. Of the different causes in the graph, we can see a clear decline in the number of suicides due to no education in both Kerala and Tripura. If not a direct link, there also seems to be a link between literacy rate and suicides caused by over alcoholism.
  From this, we can further verify my hypothesis as there is a relationship between socio-economic factors(literacy rate) and related causes for suicide.</p>


<h4 id = "three">Analysis #3: Relationship beween drug abuse, geographical location and age group. <a href="#main_content_wrap">UP</a></h4>
<p>From the first visualisation, if we click on "drug abuse" from the menu, we can notic a distinct jump in the number of suicides in Maharashtra as compared to the other states. To understand this trend I tried to visualise the suicides due to drug abuse in the top 5 states for every age group. To keep the data integrity intact, we can not directly look at the numbers as the population and size of each state is no factored in. Further, to understand this better, you can click on each state from the list and visualise them separately. I made the following analysis:
  <ul>
    <li>Kerala is the only state to have similar number of suicide cases from two age groups; 30-59.</li>
    <li>All states except kerala have a highest number of suicides in the age group 30-45.</li>
    <li>Maharashtra has the number of suicides related to drug abuse.</li>
  </ul>

  We can see from the listed points that there must be relationship between the age group of a person, their location and their reason to commit suicide. This helps in verifying my initial hypothesis.

<p> If you cannot view the visualisation from Tableau Public it is probably because you are not able to connect to their servers. This usually occurs with a number of wifi network because of their respective firewall settings. If this does not work using the Ashoka University wifi, please use mobile data or some other network to connect. If the problem still persists, please contact the owner of this website for further details.</p>
